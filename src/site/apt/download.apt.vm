 {{{https://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22${project.groupId}%22%20AND%20a%3Atomcat*-authnz-spnego-ad%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22%20AND%20p%3A%22jar%22}Maven Central}} repository.
 See the dependency information reports of the modules ({{{./tomcat85-authnz-spnego-ad/dependency-info.html}8.5}}, {{{./tomcat90-authnz-spnego-ad/dependency-info.html}9.0}}, {{{./tomcat101-authnz-spnego-ad/dependency-info.html}10.1}})
 for further integration details for your build tool of choice.

* Building from Source

  If you rather prefer building from source you either have to check out a working
  copy from the project's public {{{./scm.html}repository}},
  or download a {{{https://github.com/michael-o/tomcatspnegoad/archive/refs/tags/${project.version}.zip}source ZIP file}} from GitHub.

  After you have obtained the source code, navigate to the source code directory
  and type <<<mvn install>>>. Prior to that, make sure that you have at least Maven
  $requiredMavenVersion and Java $requiredJavaVersion installed.
  After successful execution the artifacts will be installed to your local repository.
