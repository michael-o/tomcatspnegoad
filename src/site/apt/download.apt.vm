Download ${project.name}

  There are several ways to download the JAR of this project.

* Obtaining Binaries

 The preferred way to obtain this artifact is through dependency management.
 It is available, along with its sources and Javadoc JARs, in the
 {{{https://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22${project.groupId}%22%20AND%20a%3A%22${project.artifactId}%22%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22}Maven Central}} repository.
 See the {{{./dependency-info.html}dependency information}} report for further
 integration details for your build tool of choice.

* Building from Source

  If you rather prefer building from source you either have to check out a working
  copy from the project's public {{{./source-repository.html}Subversion}} repository,
  or download a {{{https://sourceforge.net/p/tomcatspnegoad/code/HEAD/tarball?path=/tags/${project.version}}source ZIP file}} from SourceForge.

  After you have obtained the source code, navigate to the source code directory
  and type <<<mvn install>>>. Prior to that, make sure that you have at least Maven
  $context.get("maven.version") and Java $context.get("maven.compiler.target") installed.
  After successful execution the artifact will be installed to your local repository.
