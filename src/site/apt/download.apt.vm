Download ${project.name}

  There are several ways to download the JAR of this project.

* Obtaining Binaries

 The preferred way to obtain this artifact is through dependency management.
 It is available, along with its sources and Javadoc JARs, in the
 {{{http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22${project.groupId}%22%20AND%20a%3A%22${project.artifactId}%22%20AND%20v%3A%22${project.version}%22}Maven Central}} repository.
 See the {{{./dependency-info.html}dependency information}} report for further
 integration details for your build tool of choice.

 Alternatively, you can obtain a binary distribution with all JARs plus the
 entire site for offline browsing from the project's
 {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/tomcatspnegoad/files/${project.version}}SourceForge.net Files}} directory.

* Building from Source

  If you rather prefer building from source you either have to check out a working
  copy from the project's public {{{./source-repository.html}Subversion}} repository,
  or download a source tarball from the
  {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/tomcatspnegoad/files/${project.version}}SourceForge.net Files}} directory.

  After you have obtained the source code, navigate to the source code directory
  and type <<<mvn install>>>. Prior to that, make sure that you have at least Maven
  $context.get("maven.version") and Java $context.get("maven.compiler.target") installed.
  After successful execution the artifact will be installed to your local repository.
