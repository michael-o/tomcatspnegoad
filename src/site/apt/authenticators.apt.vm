Choosing and Using Authenticators

  Choose an authenticator which will determine a user's identity. Usually, the
  {{{SPNEGO_Authenticator}<<<SpnegoAuthenticator>>>}} or {{{SSL_Authenticator}<<<SSLAuthenticator>>>}}
  will do, but during local development you will find the {{{Using_an_Authenticator_During_Development}<<<CurrentWindowsIdentityAuthenticator>>>}}
  very handy.

* SPNEGO Authenticator

  The {{{./tomcat90-authnz-spnego-ad/apidocs/net/sf/michaelo/tomcat/authenticator/SpnegoAuthenticator.html}<<<SpnegoAuthenticator>>>}}
  challenges the client to perform {{{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559}SPNEGO}} authentication. In
  turn the server accepts a GSS context by validating an authentication token and responds with a
  proper token to the client.

    [Attention] Though SPNEGO is intended to negotiate a mechanism, OpenJDK currently supports
                Kerberos 5 only and not NTLM additionally due to its proprietary nature.
                Anyway, it is finally {{{https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/the-evolution-of-windows-authentication/ba-p/3926848}deprecated by Microsoft}}.

  Open or create your app's <<<context.xml>>> and add:

+----------------------------
<Context>
[$ellipsis]
  <!-- Add this -->
  <Valve className="net.sf.michaelo.tomcat.authenticator.SpnegoAuthenticator"
    loginEntryName="a-login-entry" />
[$ellipsis]
</Context>
+----------------------------

  Provide the login entry name from your <<<login.conf>>> configured for the machine or service account
  capable of accepting GSS contexts with SPNEGO/Kerberos.

  You have successfully configured the <<<SpnegoAuthenticator>>> in your webapp. It is now ready to use.

* SSL Authenticator

  The {{{https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/SSLAuthenticator.html}<<<SSLAuthenticator>>>}}
  is bundled with Tomcat and extracts user certificates from the TLS context.

  Open or create your app's <<<context.xml>>> and add:

+----------------------------
<Context>
[$ellipsis]
  <!-- Add this -->
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SSLAuthenticator" />
[$ellipsis]
</Context>
+----------------------------

  It is expected that you follow the Tomcat documentation to properly configure your <<<Connector>>>
  for certificate-based authentication.

  You have successfully configured the <<<SSLAuthenticator>>> in your webapp. It is now ready to use.

* Using an Authenticator During Development

  After examining the authenticators above and probably ask yourself: How do I use that on my local
  development machine? {{{./tomcat90-authnz-spnego-ad/apidocs/net/sf/michaelo/tomcat/authenticator/CurrentWindowsIdentityAuthenticator.html}<<<CurrentWindowsIdentityAuthenticator>>>}}
  to the rescue. It will automatically obtain the GSS credential of the currently logged in domain
  user and auto-login you in the application. This is very handy when you are running your Tomcat
  instance inside an IDE.

  Open or create your app's <<<context.xml>>> and add:

+----------------------------

<Context>
[$ellipsis]
  <!-- Add this -->
  <Valve className="net.sf.michaelo.tomcat.authenticator.CurrentWindowsIdentityAuthenticator"
    loginEntryName="a-login-entry" />
[$ellipsis]
</Context>
+----------------------------

  Provide the login entry name from your <<<login.conf>>> configured for your user account capable
  of initiating GSS contexts with SPNEGO/Kerberos.

    [Warning] Do not use this in production. This has been created for the ease of development and
              testing purposes only.

  Now you have successfully configured the <<<CurrentWindowsIdentityAuthenticator>>> in your webapp.
  It is now ready to use.

Next Step

  After you have properly configured an authenticator, go on to the {{{./realms.html}realm}}.
