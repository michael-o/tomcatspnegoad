* Origin of this Project

  Working in a corporate environment leaves you virtually no option of not having real SSO for a
  (Java) webapp, especially when this works with Microsoft IIS with a few clicks. Unfortunately,
  the Apache Tomcat did not have anything like this out of the box for years.\
  After a deep dive into Kerberos, GSS-API, TLS, PKI, Active Directory and LDAP in Java, I made a
  custom components to fill that gap. Portions of this project have been {{{https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48685}integrated}}
  into Apache Tomcat 7 and onwards. Though, this project covers much more than an authenticator.

  This library has served me very well for 10+ years and still does a great job in a complex
  multi-realm environment, hopefully it will do for you too.
