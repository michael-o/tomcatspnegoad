User Guide

  To make use of this library you must run at least Java $javaVersion and Apache Tomcat $tomcatMainVersion.

    [Prerequisites] Make sure that the machine running the Tomcat instance (a) has joined a domain,
                    (b) has an appropriate {{{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names}SPN}}
                    set, (c) has Kerberos properly configured and (d) the JVM has all necessary
                    system properties set.

    []

  This site will guide you through the components of this library:

  [[1]] {{{./authenticators.html}Authenticators}}: an authenticator challenges a client to present
        the necessary authentication token to prove its identity.

  [[2]] {{{./realms.html}Realms}}: a realm looks up the roles and other data of a user in
        Active Directory or any other user repository.

  []

  Your will need <both> components configured properly to enjoy true SSO in your company network.

  Before using this library, make sure that the main artifact and its dependencies (if not shaded)
  are in the class path of your Tomcat instance, i.e., in <<<$CATALINA_BASE/lib>>> or <<<$CATALINA_HOME/lib>>>.

* Sample Webapp

  Finally configured all components, now need to verify your setup? Read the {{{./sample-webapp.html}sample webapp setup}}.

* Spring Security

  Integrating this module within Spring Security can easily be done. Read {{{./spring-security.html}here}} how!

* Not using Active Directory but another Kerberos KDC implementation?

  If you happen <not> to use Active Directory, but MIT Kerberos or Heimdal as your KDC &#x2013; no
  problem, the authenticators are not tied to Active Directory, but simply require a working Kerberos
  setup. As for the realm, read the section on {{{./realms.html#Alternative_Realm_Implementations}alternative realm implementations}}.
