User Guide

  To make use of this library you must run at least Java #property("maven.compiler.target").

    [Warning] This works with Apache Tomcat <<6.0 only>> due to ABI changes in version 7.0.

    []

    [Prerequisites] Make sure that the machine running the Tomcat instance (a) has joined a domain,
                    (b) has an appropriate {{{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms677949%28v=vs.85%29.aspx}SPN}}
                    set, (c) has Kerberos properly configured and (d) the JVM has all necessary
                    system properties set.

  This site will guide you through the components of this library:

  [[1]] {{{./authenticators.html}Authenticators}}: An authenticator challenges a client to present
        the necessary security token to verify its identity.

  [[2]] {{{./realms.html}Realms}}: A realm looks up the roles and other data of a user in the
        Active Directory or any other user repository.

  []

  Your will need <both> components configured properly to enjoy SSO in your company network too.

  Before using this library, make sure that the main artifact and its dependencies are in the class
  path of your Tomcat instance, i.e., in <<<$CATALINA_BASE/lib>>> or <<<$CATALINA_HOME/lib>>>.

* Not using Active Directory but another Kerberos KDC implementation?

  If you happen <not> to use Active Directory but MIT Kerberos or Heimdal as your KDC &#x2013; no
  problem, the authenticators are not tied the Active Directory but simply require a working Kerberos
  setup. As for the realm, read the chapter on {{{./realms.html#Alternative_Realm_Implementations}alternative realm implementations}}.
